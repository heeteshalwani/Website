<h3> RISC-V CPU FPGA implementation </h3>
<h4> Team : Kyle Kovacs, Heetesh Alwani</h4>
<div class = "imagebehave"> <img id = "heetesh" src = "images/heetesh.jpg"><br>What a lad!</div>
<p class = "style1"> This project is the final project for Introduction to Digital Design class at UC Berkeley. We used Verilog to design the logic behind a RISC-V CPU and implemented it on a Xilinx FPGA.As an add-on, we connected the CPU to the AC97 codec and Chrontel DVI chip on the ML505 board so as to enable audio and video output. </p>

<h3> Automated Pinball Machine </h3>
<h4> Team : Russell Gray, Kyle Kovacs, Heetesh Alwani </h4>
<div class = "imagebehave"> <img id = "heetesh" src = "images/heetesh.jpg"><br>What a lad!</div>
<p class = "style1"> As part of the Embedded Systems class at UC Berkeley, we were tasked with working on a project that incorporated modelling,design and analysis. We decided to work on a pinball machine that "plays itself". We modelled the motion of the ball using kinematics and using infrared sensors, we were able to get the flipper to hit the ball non-deterministically launched by a slingshot at the right time. </p>

<h3> Laundry Sorting Robot </h3>
<h4> Team : Jillian Heng, Clarkson Chang, Ren Lingfei, Heetesh Alwani</h4>
<div class = "imagebehave"> <img id = "heetesh" src = "images/heetesh.JPG"><br>What a lad!</div>
<p class = "style1"> The final project for the Introduction to Robotics class at UC Berkeley involved a friendly robot called Baxter. We decided to apply the knowledge gained during the semester by programming Baxter to sort laundry acoording to the colour of the linen. Watch the video below to see the final result!</p>
