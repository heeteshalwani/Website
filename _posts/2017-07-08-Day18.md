Today, there was a little more drive to get things done. More so than other days. I am still a little slow on the typing. Still struggling with standing on one leg. But the goal extends beyond the 21 day challenge. I will continue till I hit my targets. I was doing the exercises while watching Breaking Bad today. I am hooked. The show just keeps on getting better.
