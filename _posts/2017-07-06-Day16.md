title: Day 16

What is strength? Is it the ability to operate at 100% even when I do not feel well. Rafael Nadal speaks about suffering on the tennis court and how he feels that it is the only way for him to get better at tennis. He is experiencing a resurgence and I hope he wins Wimbledon. It is sad that tennis hasn't seen players in the realm of Djokovic, Nadal and Federer in the next generation of players. Perhaps its because they do not see the need to suffer on the tennis court.

P.S. It is Day 16 and I feel terribly sick. And while standing on one leg, my head was throbbing. I cannot lose sight of the goal though. I must suffer a little bit. Exercises are complete.
