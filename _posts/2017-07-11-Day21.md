title: Day 21
---

I have finished the challenge. The last day of the challenge is the most memorable one purely because I went for an Argentinian Tango Dance Class and I took the bus back. I like the dance form, it is about communicating via movement, asserting and deasserting control, push and pull, I love it. I only have two more weeks here so I will not finish the sequence. However, I will continue this back in Singapore for sure. As for the bus, there is a story behind that as well. So in Dallas, the buses come once in a long while. So when I got to the bus stop, I had missed the earlier bus so the next bus was in 50 minutes. While waiting, I did my stand on one leg exercise and needless to say, I got a few stares from the cars that passed by. I want to do a roundup of the progress I have made in the past 21 days but I will leave that to tomorrow. I have to wake up in 7 hours.
