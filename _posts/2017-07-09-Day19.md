title: Day 19

Every day I learn something about myself. I learn a little more about my flaws and how the people around me deal with my flaws without telling it straight to my face. I need to control my emotion and act rationally during such times. I did my typing test today again and it seems that there is a tiny improvement. I want to improve.
