title: Day 17

Work ended early today. I did not accomplish much today. I was caught up with the technicalities of DSP that there wasn't time to start writing code. I really hope to finish the project before the end of my internship. I have three more weeks here. 15 full days of work. It can be done. On the bright side, 4 more days before I finish my own challenge. There is a slight improvement in my typing for sure but I cannot seem to hit pass 45 words per minute consistently. I feel the standing on one leg exercise is making me walk better though. So that is good news. I am glad I found out about this exercise for flat feet now rather than later.
