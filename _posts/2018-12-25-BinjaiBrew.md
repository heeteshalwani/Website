title: Why I do Binjai Brew
---

It has been a year since I came back from Berkeley. I remember making this website in one day over the weekend on a cold winter day. A lot has happened over the year. And right now, I feel that this has to be the most fulfilling year of my life. I am unsure of what lies ahead, but I am sure that I have grown as an individual. There are times when I look back over the year and ask myself, did all these things really happen? The highest of highs and the lowest of the lows. Most of it though, besides the relationships I have formed with the many people I have met, revolve around Binjai Brew.

So why do I do Binjai Brew - for anyone who is reading this, you can find out more about Binjai Brew on binjaibrew.com - is the real question that I ask myself everyday. The journey has been filled with ups and downs and I think for me to still be into it after the downs we have experienced, I must be borderline crazy. It is because, I think, of the team that I have around me, the feeling that anything can be achieved when I am around them. The way in which we experiment and do things so rapidly, with foolish fearlessness. We have stumbled so many times, and we have risen up as well, and today now that everything is ready to go, when we are launching in 4 days, I have belief that all will be well.
