title: Why I do Binjai Brew
---

It has been a year since I came back from Berkeley. I remember making this website in one day over the weekend on a cold winter day. A lot has happened over the year. And right now, I feel that this has to be the most fulfilling year of my life. I am unsure of what lies ahead, but I am sure that I have grown as an individual. There are times when I look back over the year and ask myself, did all these things really happen? The highest of highs and the lowest of the lows. Most of it though, besides the relationships I have formed with the many people I have met, revolve around Binjai Brew.
