title: It's finally done
---

I know that there is still alot more to be done. But I finally have my very own blog/website. I think to do something like this 10 years ago would have required a lot more code. These days it is alot easier. We have HTML templates, we have static site generators, we have free web hosting courtesy of Github and buying a domain is just a click away. But still, I wish it was easier.
