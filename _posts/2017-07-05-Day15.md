title: Day 15
---

I feel a little sick today. Floating on a tube in dirty green water at Fort Worth's Fourth wasn't a good idea. I did my exercises today, the main ones. No pushups and abs exercises but I am still on course to fulfill the 21 day challenge. While standing on one leg and watching HBO, I watched a scene where Mel Gibson read a suicide note, and then bumped into the girl who was suppposed to commit suicide. In the time that he was there, he realised that he could save this girl's life by saying a couple of sweet words and acknowledging her presence. I want to be able to think that quickly in social situations. Just a random thought.
