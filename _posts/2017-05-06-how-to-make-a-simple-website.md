title: Berkeley Time 
---

I find myself at the end of a journey. I will miss this place. I will miss the times when I looked across the building at 3am, and I saw like minded people still toiling away at their books. I will miss the kinship I made with that random person I met at 3am inside Cory Hall. I have struggled alot in my time here. I have always felt that I was not good enough, and at times, I was on the verge of breaking down. I also questioned if this was the path that I should take and now, I feel it was all worth.<br> Today, I found myself at Jacobs Hall and I was at the laser cutter machine cutting my last few designs in my time here at Berkeley. I made a Jigsaw puzzle. One last print before my exam which was at 3pm. I sat for my examination. It was alright. And then a good friend of mine popped up at the end of the exam and said let's go for yoghurt. It meant alot to me. The yoghurt at Menchie's was a form of respite for me during good times and bad times. It was respite on the days when I found myself at lab and barely made any progress. It was a treat on the days when I had successfully reached a milestone in the lab. And after that, it was time for me to go.
