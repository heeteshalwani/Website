The motivation to continue on this journey is waning. There are so many competing elements for my time but there is no excuse for me not being able dedicate an hour and a half everyday to self improvement. So I must persist. I need to control my mind.

For today though, I finally finished the Brown Bear Typing class and I managed to do my standing on one leg exercise. I wanted to do squats as well but I didn't come around to doing it. My toe has finally recovered though so I can exert myself at the gym again this week.
