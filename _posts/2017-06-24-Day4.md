It is 1.34am. And I just finished my tasks for today. I came back really late from Six Flags over Texas which was really great by the way. I would like at some point to make a page dedicated to reviewing theme parks.But that's for another day. 

I finished level 13 of the typing test and I did my routine stand on leg exercise. 17 more days to go.
