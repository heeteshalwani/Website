title: Day 8

It's become a habit almost. I came back home and straight away performed the exercises that I have comitted to. I figured that it is easier to get it out of the way rather than to work on something else first, and then come back to the tasks. I am going for more accuracy in my typing and also trying to stand on one leg for longer at a stretch. Tomorrow onwards, I would like to do more exercises on a daily basis. Like pushups and squats. Basically body weight exercises since it doesn't require me to go to the gym.
