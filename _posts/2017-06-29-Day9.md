title: Day 9

I like the floor. The feeling of staring right down at it. I hate the floor. It lays to bare all my fears. The feeling of pushing down and struggling to come up. But I pushed up today. And I want to continue pushing up. 

Day 8: I actually managed to hit 50 words per minute today. But its just a one off for now. When I can hit that consistently, that's when I have have achieved it. I hit 48 seconds at a stretch for the other exercise though.
