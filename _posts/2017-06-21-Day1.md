title: Day 1

So today marks the first of my 21 day attempt at cultivating a habit and improving myself. In order to improve my typing, I am using this website called bigbrownbear which takes me through a series of levels which exposes me to more keys on the keyboard stage by stage. I worked my way to level 10 today but levels 1 to 5 were not that challenging so I think I will start from level 6 tomorrow. After that, I went to a website which just had an article to type out and I managed to hit 45 words per minute which isn't too bad. At the end of 21 days, I wish to hit 60 words per minute though.<br><br>
I tried to do burpees today and I realised some real issues with my form. It is an interesting exercise in the sense that it comprises of two exercises, a mountain climber and a tuck jump. For now, I am unable to do the mountain climber correctly and this resulted in me hurting my toe. So I am going to break up the burpee and work on the mountain climber daily while also working on exercises that help improve my balance caused by my flat feet.
