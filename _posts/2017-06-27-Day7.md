title: Day 7
---

It's a little weird. I just checked my website via a URL and it seems as though certain posts didn't go through. I hope it works today. I really do not have the desire to debug right now. Work was intense today and it felt good that I made some progress. But staring at the computer the whole day is exhausting in itself and when I reached home and read a chapter of my book, I fell asleep. It was some really good sleep. If the lights were not on, I would have woken up tomorrow. 

Day 7: I completed my stand on leg exercise and typing test.
