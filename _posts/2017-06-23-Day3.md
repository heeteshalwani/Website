title: Day 3

It's Day Three and I woke up a little on the lazy side today. Was really hesitant to do anything. But I finally came around and started with standing on a leg for 20 minutes in total. After that, I did P90 X3 Yoga which is really good for a 30 minute workout. I think my performance was affected a little bit by my standing on leg workout. So I think I will do Yoga first the next time. 

I continued from yesterday on my typing test plan and I made it past level 12. Each level is getting more involved and is more time consuming but it is getting more realistic in the sense that it is incorporating commas now. And with that, it's a wrap. It's Friday night. Probably gonna check out Downtown Dallas.
