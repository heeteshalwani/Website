title: Day 2
---

I have made it to Day 2 and I think I am getting the hang of things. Reporting back to this blog is making me hold myself accountable to the goals that I set for myself. This is really exciting.

I also realised that I cannot  cheat wiith this plan of mine. Since this page is hosted on Github Pages which tracks every change I make on my website, everything that I commit is transparent. 

For today, I tried to do lunges and mountain climber but my form was terrible so there was no point in me carrying on with the exercise. Instead, I read an article that gave advice on how flat footers like myself should try to improve our balance and it mentioned that standing on one leg for 10 minutes a day really helps. And that is what I did. 10 minutes in total on each leg. Managed at best 40 seconds at a go. I really felt the burn though which is great news. If I keep this up, I am sure I will see improvement.

For my typing, I started at level 6 and I kept on going until I reached level 12. It really gets harder in the higher levels and each takes alot longer to complete. Really addictive nonetheless.
