I put my typing skills to the test today and there hasn't been any improvement since the last time. Reflecting upon it brings up two possibilities, perhaps my focus on trying to be fast increases my inaccuracy which brings down my speed or it could be that I am not applying my newly learned typing style in my general day to day typing such that the techniques do not stick. I will try to type slowly but accurately for the next week and let's see if there is any improvement. I completed my standing on one leg exercise. I managed to go 40 seconds at a stretch today. I am going to try for one minute tomorrow.

In other news, I bought a shaving package from Dollar Shave Club last week and one from Gilette on Demand this week. I am quite excited to see which blade is better. I have this impression that Gilette Blades last much longer as the hair doesn't get stuck in between the blades as regularly as Dollar Shave blades. Let's see!
