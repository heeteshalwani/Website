I wonder why some people thrive on putting others down. Being on the receiving end of negative comments has taken a toll on me and I really want to retaliate but what good will it do for me. Is the best way to retaliate to not retaliate at all? I have resorted to self-help books to help me answer that question. It is funny how at one point in my life, I used to judge my brothers for reading self-help books but now I see the value in them. It has opened my eyes to new perspectives and has made me want to improve myself.<br> I figure the only way to deal with people who thrive on putting you down is to improve yourself until my confidence renders me immune to the words of others. And with that, I want to start on the path of self-improvement. There are three aspects of myself that I would like to improve upon. Firstly, starting today, I will be proactive and this means that I will work on my thought process i.e how I approach a problem, how I execute a task. Secondly, I will work on my typing speed(currently 40 words per minute). Yes, I know this does not make sense but it is important to me. And lastly, I want to improve on my leg strength and balance and although I will be doing a variety of exercises, I would like to monitor my improvements in burpees. And I will reflect on my daily attempts at fulfilling this goals for the next 21 days. And that's a wrap. Wish me luck.
