<p>
My name is Heetesh Alwani and I am a junior on exchange at the University of California, Berkeley. I like to make things work and that is why I am studying to be an electrical engineer. The hedonist in me enjoys the 'eureka' moment, the gratification when I successfully implement a design or an idea. At the same time, I know that I can be better and this website will document my journey as I strive to become better at what I do. It will keep a check on me and will serve as a tracker of my progress. <br><br>I will document my travels, share my thoughts and reflect on my and day-to-day experiences. The notion of losing my privacy has always scared me but in a sense, my own website relinquishes any claim to that. Instead, my thoughts and frailties will be laid bare for everyone to critique and see.<br><br> This is an exciting time of my life as I am still trying to get a foothold on things or in some sense 'find myself'. Come on in and I hope you like what you see. Feel free to comment and give feedback on all sorts of things, website design, critique on my project implementation or even personal advice. But first, let me get the comment form to work!
